# OpenAPI

Esmerald as mentioned across the documentation supports natively the automatic generation of the
documentation in three different ways:

* **Swagger** - Defaults to `/docs/swagger`.
* **Redoc** - Defaults to `/docs/redoc`.
* **Stoplight** - Defaults to `/docs/elements`.

!!! Tip
    See the [OpenAPIConfig](./configurations/openapi/config.md) for more details how to take
    advantage of the defaults provided and how to change them.
